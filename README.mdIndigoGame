The Indigo game project was developed as part of a university assignment, where you worked in a group and contributed to the view layer implementation using Kotlin. 
The game, which can be played both against an AI and online, focuses on providing an interactive and engaging experience for users.

my role in the project was to design and implement the view layer, which is responsible for the user interface (UI) and ensuring smooth interaction between the user and the game. 
This layer includes graphical components, buttons, displays, and game status indicators, allowing players to interact with the game seamlessly.

Key features of the Indigo game include:

AI Gameplay: Players can play against a computer-controlled opponent, utilizing AI algorithms to provide a challenging experience.
Online Multiplayer: The game allows players to compete against each other over the internet, adding a social and competitive aspect.
View Layer: You focused on ensuring the visual elements of the game were intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly, providing players with an optimal gaming experience.
By implementing the view layer, you played a crucial role in shaping how users experience the game, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate
